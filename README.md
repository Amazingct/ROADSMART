# ROADSMART
Raspberry pi self driving robot car with deep learning using tensorflow.keras
The hardware consists of a raspberry pi (3 or 4), arduino (nano or mega), 4WD chasis, pi camera, motor driver and suitable power system
upload rasbi.py to pi
uplaod arduino.ino to arduino
use CAPTURE_DATASET program to capture training dataset while driving manually
use TRAIN to train car on dataset after capturing data
use AI_DRIVE to drive car automatically (self driving)
